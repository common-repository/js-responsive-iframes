Makes iframes responsive using some lightweight JavaScript.

== Description ==

Add the "responsive-ignore" class to avoid this for a specific frame. Note that it needs to have a width and height.  If the width is 100%, it will wrap based on its parent element and its height will remain the same.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `js-responsive-iframes` folder to the directory `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin using the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
